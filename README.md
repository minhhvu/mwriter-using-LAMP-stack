# mwriter-using-LAMP-stack
For this project, I rebuit my web - Mwriter using **Laravel** and adding more feature. The web provides users can search books and then keep track of all books in their bookshelf. They can manage their shelves (reading, completed, wishlish) and take notes. Also, the interface was designed to be more simple and consitent.

This is the higher level for me to understand full-stack web developemnt with Lavarel framework. There were some topics which I mainly worked on:
* Routing, View, Controller
* Blade Templating Engine 
* Migration and Schema Builder for Model
* Database Relationships (one-one, one-many, may-many)
* Form validation
* Authentication, middleware
